Prompt for an Internal Permit Package Tracking Application

Overview

Design an internal permit package tracking application for our organization. This app will manage permit packages for individual customers, including all associated documents and contractor information. The system ensures that each required document is completed and uploaded before a permit package can be submitted to the billing department. All functionality is restricted to internal users only, with role-based access (e.g. Permit Coordinators and Administrators) ￼. The application should also provide an AI-powered assistant (chatbot/agent) allowing users to retrieve a customer’s full permit package or specific information via natural language queries ￼. Below are the detailed requirements and features for the app.

User Roles and Security
	•	Internal-Only Access: The app must be accessible only by authorized internal staff (e.g. via company SSO or secure login). All interactions are internal, meaning no public access. This ensures sensitive permit data is protected within our network. Use role-based permissions so users only see and do what their role allows ￼.
	•	Permit Coordinators (Regular Users): These users can create and manage permit packages. They upload documents, mark documents as completed, and prepare packages for billing submission. Permit coordinators should have a user-friendly interface to track their customers’ permits and see which documents are still pending completion.
	•	Administrators: Admins have full oversight. They should have an admin dashboard that includes all the functionality of a regular user (permit coordinator) plus administrative features. The admin dashboard provides a high-level view of all permit packages in the system (with statuses of document completion), and allows management of users/roles. Administrators can review any permit package, check completeness, and mark packages as ready for billing. They may also have settings to configure the list of required documents, manage contractor lists, or oversee the AI assistant’s parameters.

(Role-based internal portals are a common design for secure employee-facing apps -- for example, internal portals often allow setting up roles like employee vs. admin, where admins have oversight of everything ￼.)

Permit Package Management
	•	Customer Profiles: The system will track individual customers and their permit packages. Each customer can have one or multiple permit packages. A permit package record includes basic info (customer name, project/address, etc.) and links to all related documents and contractors.
	•	Contractor Information: Each permit package can store details about contractors associated with that permit (e.g. the general contractor or subcontractors involved). This includes contractor name, contact info, license number, etc. The contractor info is linked to the permit package for quick reference ￼. (For instance, users should be able to see who the contractor on a permit is, and retrieve their contact details easily.)
	•	Required Documents List: For each permit package, the app should maintain a checklist of all required documents/forms (e.g. permit application form, site plans, insurance certificates, etc.). This acts as a completion checklist that must be fully satisfied before submission. The required documents could be predefined by permit type or set by admins. Users (permit coordinators) will upload each required document into the package.

Document Upload & Completion Tracking
	•	Document Uploads: Permit coordinators can upload documents (PDF, images, Word, etc.) into the permit package. Each required document has a slot in the checklist; once a file is uploaded for that item, it’s marked as provided. Users will always upload complete, finalized files, not drafts, to ensure each document is fully filled out and signed as needed.
	•	Completion Status: The app must verify that all required documents have been uploaded and marked complete before allowing the package to proceed to billing. There should be a visual indicator (e.g. a percentage or checklist) showing how many required items are completed for a given package. For example, if 9 out of 10 required forms are uploaded, the package is 90% complete; the missing item is highlighted. This helps permit coordinators quickly identify what’s outstanding. The goal is to eliminate incomplete applications by guiding users to provide all necessary documents ￼.
	•	Manual "Document Complete" Check: For each permit package, a manual review step is needed to confirm all documents are correctly completed. A permit coordinator or admin can tick a "Documents Complete" box once they verify everything is in order (initially this is a manual process, but we may automate it later). Only after this check can the package move forward. (In the future, this step might be automated by the system – for example, using software or AI to verify that each form is filled out properly – but for now it’s a manual verification.)
	•	Prevent Submission if Incomplete: If any required document is missing or not marked complete, the system should prevent submission to billing. Users attempting to submit an incomplete package should receive an alert specifying which documents are still needed. This ensures billing only receives complete permit packages, reducing back-and-forth on missing paperwork.

Billing Submission Workflow
	•	Ready for Billing Flag: Once all documents are uploaded and the permit coordinator marks the package as complete, the package can be flagged as "Ready for Billing". This could notify the billing department or simply serve as a status that admins can see. (The exact integration with billing might be manual at first – e.g., the coordinator informs billing outside the system – but the app should at least record that the package is ready for billing submission.)
	•	Future Automation: We anticipate possibly automating the billing submission in the future. For example, when a package is marked ready, the system could automatically send a notification or packet to billing. The app’s design should keep this future capability in mind (perhaps by modular design or an API integration point), though it will be a manual or separate process initially.
	•	Audit Trail: Record when a permit package is marked complete and submitted to billing (timestamps, and who performed the action). This provides accountability and tracking of the workflow.

Download/Export Permit Package Documents
	•	The application needs the ability to download all documents in a permit package together as one file or archive. With one action (e.g., a "Download All" button), users can retrieve a combined package of all the documents for that permit. This could be implemented as a ZIP file containing all the individual files, or potentially a single PDF in which all documents are appended. This feature will greatly simplify providing the complete package to billing or other departments.
	•	For example, an admin or coordinator can open a permit package record, click "Download All Documents," and the system will bundle every attached file in that package into one downloadable ZIP ￼. This saves time compared to downloading each file one by one. (In similar permitting systems, bulk download of attachments is a common feature – e.g., selecting all attachments and downloading as a ZIP file ￼.)
	•	Ensure the downloaded bundle is named clearly (perhaps with the permit number or customer name) to avoid confusion. Also, maintain any folder structure or file naming conventions that help identify each document in the package.

AI Assistant Integration (Natural Language Queries)
	•	AI-Powered Agent: Integrate an AI assistant (chatbot) into the application to facilitate natural language queries and tasks. Users (particularly those less tech-savvy) should be able to interact with the system by asking in plain English for what they need, and the AI agent will fetch it.
	•	Document Retrieval via Chat: For example, a user could type or ask: "Get John Doe’s permit package paperwork". The AI agent will understand this request, search the database for John Doe’s permit package, gather all associated documents, and present the user with the option to download the bundle (just as if they clicked "Download All") or view the details. This provides a conversational shortcut to retrieving a customer’s documents, without the user manually navigating through menus.
	•	Contextual Data Queries: The AI assistant can also answer questions about the permits and documents. For instance, a user might ask: "Which documents are still missing for Permit #123?" and the agent can respond with the list of required items not yet uploaded. Or, "Show me the contractor’s license info for Jane Smith’s permit." The AI should pull that information from the stored data ￼.
	•	Natural Language Processing: The agent should be capable of understanding references to customers, permits, and documents in natural language. This means implementing NLP that maps names and terms to the records in our system. It should handle variations in phrasing (e.g., "Show me so-and-so’s paperwork" or "I need all files for Smith’s permit").
	•	Integration with Files: The AI assistant will have access to the content of uploaded documents to some extent, enabling it to answer questions about document details if needed. For example, users could ask, "Does John Doe’s permit package have an insurance certificate included?" and the agent can confirm based on the presence of that document or even read the document content if OCR is available. (This concept is inspired by emerging tools like iWorQ’s AI assistant for permit management, which lets users query their uploaded permit files in plain language ￼. iWorQ’s assistant can quickly surface details such as contractor info or ordinance details from the documents ￼, illustrating the efficiency gains for staff.)
	•	User Experience: The chat interface should be easily accessible (for example, a chat icon or a sidebar in the app). Staff can click it and type a question or request. The agent will respond with answers or actions (and provide a "Download" link when fulfilling a request like gathering documents). This is particularly useful for employees who are not very familiar with traditional computer navigation, as they can simply "ask" for what they need in a human-friendly way ￼ ￼. The tone of interaction should be clear and helpful.
	•	Permissions in AI: The AI assistant must respect user permissions – e.g. a permit coordinator’s queries only retrieve data from permits they have access to, whereas an admin’s queries can access all data ￼. This prevents someone from using the chat to bypass security controls.

Administrator Dashboard & Features
	•	The Admin Dashboard should provide an overview of the entire permit system. Key metrics or lists might include: number of active permit packages, which packages are pending documents, which are ready for billing, and perhaps aging information (how long packages have been open).
	•	Admins can search or filter all permit packages, e.g., see all packages by customer name, address, or status. They should also be able to pull reports, like "show all packages ready for billing" or "packages missing documents."
	•	User Management: Administrators should have controls to manage internal users of the app (add/remove permit coordinators, reset passwords or manage roles if not integrated with SSO). They can assign or restrict permissions as needed. This ensures only internal employees (and the correct ones) are using the system. (In internal portals, it’s common for admins to set up user groups/roles and control access rights ￼.)
	•	Configuration: Admins may maintain reference data like the list of required document types for permits, the list of contractors (or perhaps approve contractor entries), etc. If a new form becomes required for permits, the admin can update the checklist template. If integrating with other systems (like a billing system in the future), the admin can configure API keys or settings here.
	•	Monitoring and Logs: The admin interface could include an activity log or audit trail showing key events (document uploads, completion marked, submissions to billing, AI queries made, etc.) for compliance and troubleshooting. For instance, if a document went missing, admins can see who uploaded or removed anything.

Permit Coordinator Interface
	•	The Permit Coordinator’s view (regular user interface) should be straightforward and task-focused. They likely have a list or dashboard of the permit packages they are managing (or all packages if not too many, possibly filterable by customer or status).
	•	For each permit package, they should see the required documents checklist with upload status. Uploading a document should be as simple as clicking the specific requirement (e.g. "Upload Site Plan") and attaching the file. The interface can then mark that item as completed.
	•	The coordinator can edit package details (customer info, contractor info) if needed. They should also be able to add notes or comments if there are special circumstances (e.g. "Waiting on client for updated form").
	•	There should be a clear button to mark the package ready for billing (which would only activate once all required docs are in). Perhaps the system can prompt "All documents are present. Mark this package complete and notify billing?"
	•	Coordinators can also use the AI assistant from their interface to speed up their work (for example, asking the AI "Did I upload all files for Permit #123?" and it could answer what’s missing). This can guide them on what to do next without manually cross-checking.
	•	Emphasize ease of use: since some staff are not very computer-savvy, the UI should be clean, with natural language labels and possibly tooltips. The AI assistant serves as a safety net for finding information without needing to click through many screens.

Additional Considerations
	•	Tech Stack & Output: Since this prompt will be used in LastApp (an AI app builder that generates iOS, Android, and Web apps from a prompt), the output should be a responsive web app (accessible via browsers for desktop use) and possibly also available as a mobile app for on-the-go access, all sharing the same backend. LastApp should set up a database for storing user accounts, customers, permits, documents metadata (and file storage), etc. Include any necessary AI/ML model or integration for the assistant feature (possibly connecting to an LLM or an indexed document store).
	•	File Storage: The application needs a secure file storage solution for the uploaded documents (could be cloud storage or on-premise, depending on internal policy). Ensure that file access is secure and only through the app (e.g., protected URLs or direct download via the app backend).
	•	Performance: Even though it’s internal, the app might handle many documents and users over time, so consider performance optimization for listing documents, searching, and using the AI. Perhaps implement search indexing on document metadata to speed up queries. The AI assistant might require indexing document contents (for semantic search); this could be done in the background as files are added.
	•	Future Enhancements: Keep the design extensible. For example, the future might bring: automated document scanning (AI that checks if a form is filled out correctly or signed), integration with an e-signature system for contractors or customers, direct integration to send the completed package to a billing system or generate an invoice, and expanded AI capabilities (like answering regulatory questions or deadlines). The prompt mainly focuses on current needs (tracking and completeness), but the codebase should be organized to allow such extensions.

Prompt Summary (for LastApp)

(The following is a concise summary of the app requirements, combining the above points, which can be used directly as the LastApp prompt input.)

"Build an internal Permit Package Tracking application for a company. It should manage customers and their permit packages, each containing multiple required documents and associated contractor info. Key features: Only authorized internal users can access (secure login). There are two roles: Admin and Permit Coordinator. Permit Coordinators can create a permit package for a customer, fill in customer & project details, link one or more contractors to it, and upload all required documents for that permit. The app maintains a checklist of required documents for each permit; all documents must be uploaded and marked complete before the package can be submitted to billing. Permit coordinators mark the package as complete when all docs are present (initially a manual check). The app then allows them to flag it as ready and submit to the billing department (for now just mark as ready, future automation planned). Users can download all documents in a permit package at once (e.g. one-click to get a ZIP of all files) ￼. Administrators have an extra dashboard to view all permit packages, monitor which are pending or completed, and manage users/permissions. The app integrates an AI assistant (chatbot) to help staff via natural language – e.g. a user can ask "Get me John Doe’s permit documents" and the assistant will find John’s permit package and provide all its info and a download link ￼. The AI can answer questions about permit data (like missing documents or contractor contact info ￼) using the uploaded files and stored data. The UI should be simple and clear for non-technical users, with the AI chat available to quickly retrieve information. Support standard features like secure file storage for documents, audit logs, and a responsive design for web (with optional mobile access).**" ￼ ￼

This prompt should guide LastApp to generate a full-stack application with the described data models (customers, permits, documents, contractors, users/roles), front-end interfaces for coordinators/admin, and integration of an AI assistant for document queries. The end result will be a robust internal tool that streamlines permit package management, ensures completeness of submissions, and leverages AI for efficiency, all within a secure internal environment.

Sources: The design draws on best practices in permit tracking and internal portals, as seen in industry solutions. For instance, modern permit tracking software emphasizes centralized document management and preventing incomplete submissions ￼. Internal employee portals enforce role-based access and permissions for security ￼. Bulk downloading of all permit documents as a ZIP is a common feature in permitting systems ￼. Additionally, integrating AI assistants for document-heavy workflows is an emerging trend – e.g., iWorQ’s permit management AI allows users to query and retrieve info from permit files with natural language ￼ ￼, and Filevine’s legal platform shows the value of conversationally accessing case documents ￼. These inspirations help ensure our app is user-friendly, efficient, and aligned with current technology trends in document management and AI.
